# Questions

## Inversions

The most formal way of asking a question is to use an **inversion**, where the verb appears before its pronoun and the two are connected by a hyphen.

*   _Boit-il ?_ — Does he drink? / Is he drinking? / He drinks?
*   _Boivent-ils du lait ?_ — Do they drink milk? / Are they drinking milk? / They drink milk?

However, if the subject of the sentence is a noun, then the noun should appear before the verb, although a pronoun still needs to appear afterwards.

*   _Le lait est-il froid ?_ — Is the milk cold?
*   _Les chats sont-ils noirs ?_ — Are the cats black?

If the verb ends in a vowel, the letter T must be inserted after the verb for euphony. This T is chaîned onto the pronoun and is meaningless.

*   _A-**t**-il un chien ?_ — Does he have a dog?
*   _Parle-**t**-elle anglais ?_ — Does she speak English?

Inverted forms still obey other grammar rules, like those for _il est_ vs. _c'est_. However, the pronoun in an inversion cannot elide.

*   _Est-ce un problème ?_ — Is it a problem?
*   _Est-elle médecin ?_ — Is she a doctor?
*   _Puis-je aider les enfants ?_ — Can I help the children?

## Est-ce Que

**_Est-ce que_** (pronounced like "essk") can be added in front of a statement to turn it into a question. Remember that _que_ elides in front of vowel sounds.

*   **_Est-ce qu'_**_il boit ?_ — Does he drink? / Is he drinking?
*   **_Est-ce que_** _c'est un problème ?_ — Is it a problem?
*   **_Est-ce qu'_**_il a un chien ?_ — Does he have a dog?

## Intonation

In informal speech, one of the most common ways to ask a question is simply to raise your intonation at the end of a statement, like you'd do in English.

*   _Il boit ?_ — Is he drinking?
*   _Il pleut ?_ — Is it raining?

## Interrogatives

An **interrogative** word introduces a question. French has interrogative adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs.

### Interrogative Adjectives

French has one **interrogative adjective** with four forms. It translates to "which" or "what" depending on the context.

</tr>

An interrogative adjective cannot stand alone. It must modify (and agree with) a noun, and that noun must either be adjacent to it or separated by a form of _être_.

*   _Quelle fille ?_ — Which girl?
*   _Quel est le problème ?_ — What is the problem?

_Quel_ is also an **exclamatory adjective** in statements.

*   _Quelle chance !_ — What luck!
*   _Quel grand garçon il est !_ — What a tall boy he is!

### Interrogative Pronouns

Unlike an adjective, an **interrogative pronoun** can stand alone. For instance, the interrogative pronoun _lequel_ can replace _quel_ + noun. Note that it agrees with the noun it replaces.

<table>

<th>Lequel Form</th>

<td>_Quel cheval ?_ — Which horse?</td>

<td>_Lequel ?_ — Which one?</td>

<tr>

<td>_Quels hommes mangent ?_ — Which men eat?</td>

<td>_Lesquels mangent ?_ — Which ones eat?</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>_Quelle robe est rose?_ — Which dress is pink?</td>

<td>_Laquelle est rose ?_ — Which one is pink?</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>_Quelles lettres ?_ — Which letters?</td>

<td>_Lesquelles ?_ — Which ones?</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

The most common interrogative pronouns are **_qui_** (for people) and **_que_** (for everything else). However, the construction changes based on a number of factors. _Qui_ is the only pronoun that can start a question by itself, but both _qui_ and _que_ can be used with inversion.

*   _Qui parle ?_ — Who is speaking?
*   _Qui es-tu ?_ — Who are you?
*   _Que fait-il ?_ — What is he making?

Both can also use _est-ce_, but _est-ce_ **_que_** (which you learned above) can only be used in a question with _être_ or when the pronoun is the object ("what" or "whom"). When it's the subject, _est-ce_ **_qui_** must be used.

*   _Qui est-ce **qui** parle ?_ — Who's speaking? (subj.)
*   _Qu'est-ce **qui** se passe ?_ — What is going on? (subj.)
*   _Qui est-ce **que** tu appelles ?_ — Whom are you calling? (obj.)
*   _Qu'est-ce **que** c'est ?_ — What is it? (question with _être_)

After prepositions and at the end of questions, _que_ becomes _quoi_.

*   _Le problème est quoi ?_ — What's the problem?
*   _À quoi pensez-vous ?_ — What are you thinking about?

_Qui_ and _que_ can be very confusing because they can also be relative pronouns. _Que_ can also be a subordinating conjunction. You will learn these uses later.

### Interrogative Adverbs

A number of **interrogative adverbs** can be used to request information

*   **_Pourquoi_** ("why"): _Pourquoi manges-tu du pain ?_ — Why are you eating bread?
*   **_Comment_** ("how"): _Comment allez-vous ?_ — How are you?
*   **_Quand_** ("when"): _Quand est-ce que tu vas manger ?_ — When are you going to eat?
*   **_Combien_** ("how many/much"): _Combien d'eau ?_ — How much water?  

*   **_Où_** ("where"): _Où suis-je ?_ — Where am I?

Note that when these adverbs are used with intonation-based questions, they can appear at the beginning or the end of the sentence (except _pourquoi_).

*   _Tu vas comment ?_ — How are you?
*   _Vous êtes d'où ?_ — Where are you from?

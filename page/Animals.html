<h2>Noun Genders</h2>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of learning French is memorizing noun genders. However, by spending some time now memorizing the following patterns, you may be able to guess most nouns' genders and save yourself a lot of trouble in the future.</p>
<p>Some nouns, like <em>l'élève</em> ("the student"), have the same spelling and meaning in both forms. Other nouns have the same spelling, but have different meanings. <em>Un tour</em> is a tour, while <em>une tour</em> is a tower. There are also nouns that only have one possible gender. Even a baby girl is <em>un bébé</em>, for instance. Many masculine nouns can be changed to a feminine form simply by adding an <em>-e</em> to the end. Your male friend is <em>un ami</em> and your female friend is <em>une amie</em>.</p>
<p>Some genders depend on a noun's classification. For instance, languages, days of the week, months, seasons, metals, colors, and measurements are mostly masculine. </p>
<p>Otherwise, memorizing word endings is the best way to guess genders. We'll learn these ending patterns in four steps:</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> Nouns ending in <em>-e</em> tend to be feminine. All others, especially nouns ending in consonants, tend to be masculine. This is true for over 70% of all nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> Nouns that have the endings <em>-ion</em> and <em>-son</em> tend to be feminine, even though they end in consonants.</p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> Some nouns ending in <em>-e</em> are usually masculine, especially nouns with the following endings:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-tre</em>, <em>-ble</em>, <em>-cle</em> (think "treble clef")</li>
<li><em>-one</em>, <em>-ème</em>, <em>-ège</em> (think "OMG")</li>
<li><em>-age</em>, <em>-isme</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> Watch out for these complications:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>-é</em> is masculine, but <em>-té</em> is feminine.<ul>
<li><em>le résumé</em> (masc) — the resumé</li>
<li><em>la liberté</em> (fem) — the liberty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>-de</em> is masculine, but <em>-ade</em>, <em>-nde</em>, and <em>-ude</em> are feminine.<ul>
<li><em>le guide</em> — the guide</li>
<li><em>la parade</em> — the parade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>-ste</em> and <em>-me</em> tend to be masculine, but there are dozens of exceptions. Words for people ending in <em>-ste</em> are often gender-neutral, e.g. <em>le/la cycliste</em>.</li>
<li><em>-eur</em> is masculine for most professions or technical terms, but it's feminine for some emotions and abstract things.<ul>
<li><em>le chauffeur</em> — the driver</li>
<li><em>la peur</em> — the fear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Memorize these, and you'll be able to guess most noun genders.</p>
<h2>Feminine Animals</h2>
<p>In French, female animal nouns are generally formed as follows by taking the last consonant, doubling it, and adding a mute <em>-e</em> to the end.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>un cha<strong>t</strong> ⇒ une cha<strong>tte</strong></em></li>
<li><em>un chie<strong>n</strong> ⇒ une chie<strong>nne</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are many exceptions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>un ours</em> ⇒ <em>une ourse</em> (not <em>une oursse</em>)</li>
<li><em>un cheval</em> ⇒ <em>une jument</em> (not <em>une chevalle</em>)</li>
</ul>

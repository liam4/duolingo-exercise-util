# Verbs: Present 2

## Group 3 Verbs

As you learned in "Verbs Present 1", Group 3 verbs are considered irregular, but some sparse patterns do exist among the _-ir_ and _-er_ verbs in this group.

Among the G3 _-ir_ verbs, some conjugate like _dormir_, while verbs like _ouvrir_ conjugate as though they're _-er_ verbs. Note that singular conjugations of _dormir_ drop the last letter of the root. Also, while some _-re_ verbs (such as _attendre_, _entendre_, and _perdre_) conjugate like _vendre_, dozens of other conjugation patterns exist, so it's best to memorize each verb's conjugation individually.

## Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

Sentences can have grammatical objects, which are nouns that are affected by a verb. There are two types of objects: **direct objects**, which are nouns acted upon, and **indirect objects**, which are nouns that are indirectly affected by the action.

*   **Ben** threw **the ball** at **him**.

In this example, "Ben" is the subject, "the ball" is the direct object, and "him" is the indirect object. You can usually recognize indirect objects in English by looking for a preposition after a verb. Identifying objects is important, especially in French.

Verbs can be transitive, intransitive, or both. **Transitive verbs** can have direct objects, while **intransitive verbs** cannot. However, both types of verbs can have indirect objects.

*   Transitive: _Je lance une chaussure._ — I throw a shoe.
*   Intransitive: _Je parle à Jacques._ — I am speaking to Jacques.

_Parler_ is an interesting example because it's intransitive for everything but language names.

*   Transitive: _Je parle anglais._ — I speak English.

French verbs can be tricky for Anglophones because some transitive verbs in French have intransitive English translations and vice versa. Pay attention to this.

*   Transitive: _Le chat regarde le chien._
*   Intransitive: The cat is looking at the dog.
*   Intransitive: _Il téléphone à son ami._
*   Transitive: He is calling his friend.

## Stative Verbs in English

Unlike dynamic verbs, which describe actions and processes, **stative verbs** describe states of being—physical and mental states, possession, sensations, and so on. The most common stative verb is "to be". Here are some other common examples:

*   Possessing: belong, get, have, own, possess
*   Feeling: hate, like, love, need, want
*   Sensing: feel, hear, see, smell, taste
*   Thinking: believe, know, recognize, think, understand

The most important detail about stative verbs is that they can't be used in continuous tenses in English.

*   _C'est mon fils._ — He is my son. (Not "is being".)
*   _Je veux une pomme._ — I want an apple. (Not "am wanting".)
*   _Elle aime son chien._ — She loves her dog. (Not "is loving".)
*   _On a deux amis._ — We have two friends. (Only cannibals "are having" their friends.)

You may have noticed that some verbs can be both stative and dynamic based on context. For instance:

*   "To have" can be dynamic when it means "to consume".
*   "To feel" is stative, but "to feel sick" or "to feel better" are dynamic.
*   "To be" can be dynamic when it means "to act".

Pay attention to this nuance when translating into English. This problem rarely occurs when translating to French because it lacks continuous tenses.

## Impersonal Expressions

A number of other impersonal verbs have to do with weather.

*   **_Pleuvoir_** ("to rain"): _Il pleut._ — It is raining.
*   **_Neiger_** ("to snow"): _Il neige._ — It is snowing.
*   **_Faire chaud_** ("to be warm"): _Il fait chaud aujourd'hui._ — It is warm today.

_Chaud_ can be replaced with a number of other adjectives, like _froid_ ("cold") or _humide_ ("humid").

## Confusing Verbs

Like their English counterparts, **_voir_** ("to see") and **_regarder_** ("to watch") differ based on the subject's intention. If the subject is actively watching or looking for something, use _regarder_. Otherwise, use _voir_.

*   _Le chat regarde le poisson._ — The cat is watching the fish.
*   _Elle peut voir la ville._ — She can see the city.

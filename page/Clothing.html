<h2>Idiomatic Plurals</h2>
<p>English has a number of idiomatic plural-only nouns that have to be translated carefully. These are not just nouns that are invariable with number (like "deer"), but rather nouns that cannot refer to a singular thing at all.</p>
<p>For instance, "the pants" can only be plural in English, but the corresponding <em>le pantalon</em> is singular in French. A single pair of pants is not <em>les pantalons</em>, which refers to multiple pairs of pants. Similarly, when translating <em>le pantalon</em> back to English, you can say "the pants" or "a pair of pants", but "a pant" is not correct. This also applies to <em>un jean</em> ("a pair of jeans").</p>
<p><em>Un vêtement</em> refers to a single article of clothing, and it's incorrect to translate it as "clothes", which is plural and refers to a collection of clothing. This would have to be <em>des vêtements</em>.</p>
<h2>Diacritics</h2>
<p><strong>The acute accent</strong> <strong>(é)</strong> only appears on E and produces a pure [e] that isn't found in English. To make this sound, say the word "cliché", but hold your tongue perfectly still on the last vowel to avoid making a diphthong sound.</p>
<p><strong>The grave accent</strong> <strong>(è)</strong> can appear on A/E/U, though it only changes the sound for E (to [ɛ], which is the E in "lemon"). Otherwise, it distinguishes homophones like <em>a</em> (a conjugated form of <em>avoir</em>) and <em>à</em> (a preposition).</p>
<p><strong>The cedilla</strong> <strong>(ç)</strong> softens a normally hard C sound to the soft C in "cent". Otherwise, a C followed by an A, O, or U has a hard sound like the C in "car".</p>
<p><strong>The circumflex</strong> <strong>(ê)</strong> usually means that an S used to follow the vowel in Old French or Latin. (The same is true of the acute accent.) For instance, <em>île</em> was once "isle".</p>
<p><strong>The trema</strong> <strong>(ë)</strong> indicates that two adjacent vowels must be pronounced separately, like in <em>Noël</em> ("Christmas") and <em>maïs</em> ("corn").</p>
<h2>Nasal Vowels</h2>
<p>There are four nasal vowels in French. Try to learn these sounds by listening to native speakers.</p>

<p>These aren't always nasalized. If there's a double M or N, or if they are followed by any vowel, then the vowel should have an oral sound instead. For instance, <em>un</em> is nasal, but <em>une</em> is not. Also, <em>vin</em> is nasal, but <em>vinaigre</em> is not.</p>

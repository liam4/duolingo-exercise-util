# Adjectives 2

## Multiple Adjectives

When multiple adjectives modify a noun, they should come before or after the noun based on the same rules as if they were the only adjective. This means that adjectives may straddle the noun if one is a BANGS adjective.

*   _La grande robe rouge_ — The big red dress
*   _Une jeune fille française_ — A young French girl

If two adjectives appear on the same side, you can separate them with _et_.

*   _J'ai un chapeau blanc et bleu._ — I have a white and blue hat.
*   _L'homme fort et sérieux_ — The strong and serious man

On the other hand, when there are multiple nouns being described by one adjective, that adjective takes the masculine plural by default.

*   _Un garçon et une fille italiens_ — An Italian boy and girl
*   _J'ai une chemise et un manteau simples._ — I have a simple shirt and coat.

However, if the nouns are all feminine, then they can take the feminine plural.

*   _La robe et la jupe vertes_ — The green dress and skirt

## _Grand_ or _Gros_?

_Grand_ and _gros_ can both mean "big", but they're only partly interchangeable.

_Grand_ tends to be used for:

*   General size: _La grande robe_ — The big dress
*   Height: _L'enfant est grand._ — The child is tall/big.
*   Area: _La ville est grande._ — The city is big.
*   Figurative size: _La grande richesse_ — The great wealth
*   Importance: _Un grand homme_ — A great man

_Gros_ tends to be used for:

*   Thickness or volume: _Une grosse boîte de petits-pois_ — A big can of peas
*   Fatness: _Un gros chat_ — A fat cat
*   Things that are round: _Une grosse pomme_ — A big apple
*   Seriousness: _Un gros problème_ — A big (serious) problem

## Faux Amis

Many English and French words look alike and share meanings. This is because English is heavily influenced by French and Latin. However, there are **_faux amis_** ("false friends") that look similar but do not have the same meaning. For instance, _gros_ looks like "gross", but their meanings are not the same. Be careful before assuming a French word's meaning based on its English lookalike.

<p>Verb conjugations are classified in two ways: <strong>tense</strong> and <strong>mood</strong>. Tenses reflect a time frame (e.g. present tense), while moods reflect a speaker's attitude. So far, you've mainly used the <strong>indicative mood</strong> (for facts and certainties), but it is only one of seven moods.</p>
<h2>The Infinitive Mood</h2>
<p>The <strong>infinitive mood</strong> is an impersonal mood that isn't conjugated nor associated with any subject pronoun. It can be used in a variety of constructions, either with or without prepositions.</p>
<h3>Without Prepositions</h3>
<p>Infinitives are often the objects of conjugated semi-auxiliary verbs such as <em>vouloir</em>, <em>pouvoir</em>, and <em>aimer</em>. You learned this in "Verbs: Present 1".</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ça va <strong>venir</strong>.</em> — It is going to come.</li>
<li><em>Je veux <strong>danser</strong>.</em> — I want to dance.</li>
<li><em>J'aime <strong>avoir</strong> un chat.</em> — I like having a cat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Infinitives can also act like nouns and can be used as subjects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Faire</em></strong> <em>du café est facile.</em> — Making coffee is easy.</li>
<li><strong><em>Cuisiner</em></strong> <em>et <strong>nettoyer</strong> sont ses responsabilités.</em> — Cooking and cleaning are his responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, note that French infinitives can often be translated as English gerunds (with an -ing ending), especially when they're subjects.</p>
<h3>After Verbs + Prepositions</h3>
<p>As you learned previously, some verbs must be followed by a preposition to complete their meaning (e.g. <em>penser à</em>). An infinitive can be used as a object when it follows such prepositions.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Elle parle <strong>de cuisiner</strong> le poulet.</em> – She is talking about cooking the chicken.</li>
<li><em>Je pense <strong>à changer</strong> de job.</em> – I am thinking about changing jobs.</li>
<li><em>Je vous remercie <strong>de laver</strong> les verres.</em> – I thank you for washing the glasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since infinitives can act like nouns, they can follow <em>être</em> + <em>de</em> to describe or define a subject (as a subject complement).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mon travail <strong>est de cuisiner</strong>.</em> – My job is to cook.</li>
<li><em>L'objectif <strong>est d'apprendre le francais</strong>.</em> – The goal is to learn French.</li>
</ul>
<p>The preposition <em>pour</em> ("for" or "in order to") can come before an infinitive to express the purpose of an action.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je lis <strong>pour apprendre</strong>.</em> — I read [in order] to learn.</li>
<li><em>Je viens <strong>pour parler</strong>.</em> — I am coming [in order] to talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that conjugated verbs should never come after prepositions.</p>
<h3>After Nouns</h3>
<p>An infinitive can also modify a noun when used with <em>de</em> or <em>à</em>. It may take practice to decide which preposition should be used, but in general, use <em>de</em> whenever the infinitive has an object.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Merci de laver les verres.</em> — Thanks for washing the glasses.</li>
<li><em>Il prend le temps de manger une pomme.</em> — He takes the time to eat an apple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <em>à</em> when the verb in the sentence is <em>avoir</em> (with the translation "to have").</p>
<ul>
<li><em>J'ai une décision à prendre.</em>  — I have a decision to make.</li>
<li><em>Il a un examen à préparer</em>  — He has an exam to prepare.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>À</em> can also be used to indicate the purpose of a noun. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>une maison à vendre</em> — a house for sale</li>
<li><em>l'eau à boire</em> — drinking water</li>
</ul>
<h3>After Adjectives</h3>
<p>Infinitives can be used with the construction <em>il est</em> + adjective + <em>de</em> to create impersonal expressions. Remember from "Common Phrases" that an impersonal statement is one with a dummy subject instead of a real one.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il est possible <strong>de</strong> manger maintenant.</em> — It is possible to eat now.</li>
<li><em>Il est nécessaire de boire <strong>de</strong> l’eau.</em> — It is necessary to drink water.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the subject <em>il</em> is a real thing instead of just a dummy subject, then you must use <em>à</em> instead of <em>de</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cette tâche est facile <strong>à</strong> faire.</em> — This task is easy to do.</li>
<li><em>C'est bon <strong>à</strong> savoir.</em> — That's good to know.</li>
</ul>
<p>To further illustrate the difference, consider these two different translations of "It is fun to read." The first is a general statement, while the second is a statement about a real subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il est amusant de lire.</em> (Impersonal) — It is fun to read. / Reading is fun.</li>
<li><em>Il est amusant à lire.</em> (Real) — It (e.g. a book) is fun to read.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causative Faire</h2>
<p><em>Faire</em> often appears before a verb to indicate that the subject causes something to happen instead of performing it. It's often used in relation to foods.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il <strong>fait bouillir</strong> le thé.</em> — He boils the tea.</li>
<li><em>J'aime <strong>faire griller</strong> du poulet.</em> — I like grilling chicken.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also be used to indicate that the subject has directed someone else to perform an action.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je le fais <strong>réparer</strong>.</em> — I am having it fixed. </li>
<li><em>Je fais <strong>partir</strong> mon ami.</em> — I am making my friend leave.</li>
</ul>

## Demonstrative Adjectives

**Demonstrative adjectives** ("this", "that", "these", and "those") modify nouns so they refer to something or someone specific. They can be used in place of articles. Like other adjectives, they must agree with the nouns they modify.

The singular masculine _ce_ becomes _cet_ in front of a vowel sound for euphony.

*   **_Ce_** _livre est rouge._ — That book is red.
*   **_Cet_** _arbre est grand._ — That tree is big.
*   **_Cette_** _pomme est rouge._ — That apple is red.
*   **_Ces_** _livres et ces pommes sont rouges._ — Those books and those apples are red.

_Ce_ can mean either "this" or "that". It's ambiguous between the two. To specify, use the suffix _-ci_ ("here") or _-là_ ("there") on the modified noun.

*   _Ce livre**-ci** est rouge._ — This book is red.
*   _Ces chats**-là** sont noirs._ — Those cats are black.

French learners often confuse the demonstrative adjective _ce_ with the pronoun _ce_ (from "Être-Avoir"). Discerning between them is easy, however: an adjective must modify a noun, while a pronoun can stand alone as a subject or object. Compare:

*   **Adjective:** _Ces hommes sont mes amis._ — These men are my friends.
*   **Pronoun:** _Ce sont mes amis._ — They are my friends.

In the first example, _ces_ is an adjective that modifies _hommes_, but in the second, _ce_ is a subject pronoun.

## Ça

The **indefinite demonstrative pronoun** **_ça_** refers to an unnamed concept or thing. When it's used as an object, it usually translates to "this" or "that".

*   _Tu manges ça._ — You are eating this.
*   _Je veux ça._ — I want that.

_Ça_ can also be used as a subject, in which case it can also mean "it".

*   _Ça sent bon._ — It smells good.
*   _Ça semble simple._ — This seems simple.

### _Ça_ or _Ce_?

A simple rule of thumb to follow is that _ce_ should be used with _être_, including in the double-verb constructions _pouvoir être_ and _devoir être_.

*   _C’est un très bon vin !_ — This is a really good wine!
*   _Ce sont des garçons._ — They are boys.
*   _Ce peut être triste en hiver._ — It can be sad in winter.
*   _Ce doit être ton fils._ — It must be your son.

_Ça_ should be used with all other verbs.

*   _Ça va bien._ — It's going well.
*   _Ça dure un jour._ — That lasts a day.
*   _Ça m'intéresse beaucoup._ — That interests me a lot.

However, when an object pronoun comes before _être_, then you must use _ça_, not _ce_. This is relatively rare.

*   _Ça m'est égal._ — It's all the same to me.

Also, note that _ça_ is informal and is usually replaced by _cela_ ("that") or _ceci_ ("this") in writing.

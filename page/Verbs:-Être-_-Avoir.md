Congratulations on passing the first checkpoint!

## To Be and To Have

_Être_ and _avoir_ are the most common verbs in French. Like many common verbs, they have irregular conjugations.

There should be a liaison between _ils_ or _elles_ and _ont_ ("il-zon" or "elle-zon"). The "z" sound is essential here to differentiate between "they are" and "they have", so be sure to emphasize it.

These two verbs are very important because they can act as **auxiliary verbs** in French, but they differ from their English equivalents. In "Basics 2", you learned that "I write" and "I am writing" both translate to _j'écris_, not _je suis écris_. This is because _être_ cannot be used as an auxiliary in a simple tense. It can only be used in compound tenses, which you will learn in the "Passé Composé" unit.

Another important distinction is that _avoir_ means "to have" in the sense of "to possess", but not "to consume" or "to experience". Other verbs must be used for these meanings.

## _C'est_ or _Il Est?_

When describing people and things with _être_ in French, you usually can't use a personal subject pronoun like _elle_. Instead, you must use the impersonal pronoun _ce_, which can also mean "this" or "that". Note that _ce_ is invariable, so it can never be _ces sont_.

These pronouns aren't interchangeable. The basic rule is that you must use _ce_ when _être_ is followed by any determiner—for instance, an article or a possessive adjective. Note that _c'est_ should be used for singulars and _ce sont_ should be used for plurals.

*   _C'est **un** homme._ — He's a man. / This is a man. / That is a man.
*   _Ce sont **des** chats._ — They're cats. / These are cats. / Those are cats.
*   _C'est **mon** chien._ — It's my dog. / This is my dog. / That's my dog.

If an adjective, adverb, or both appear after _être_, then use the personal pronoun.

*   _Elle est belle_. — She is beautiful. (Or "It is beautiful.")
*   _Il est très fort._ — He is very strong. (Or "It is very strong.")

As you know, nouns generally need determiners, but one important exception is that professions, nationalities, and religions can act as adjectives after _être_. This is optional; you can also choose to treat them as nouns.

*   He is a doctor. — _Il est médecin._ / _C'est **un** médecin._

However, _c'est_ should be used when using an adjective to make a general comment about (but not describe) a thing or situation. In this case, use the masculine singular form of the adjective.

*   _C'est normal ?_ — Is this normal?
*   _Non, c'est étrange._ — No, this is strange.

## Idioms with _Avoir_

One of the most common idioms in French is the use of the verb _avoir_ in certain places where English would use the verb "to be". This is especially common for states or conditions that a person may experience.

*   _Elle a chaud._ — She is hot. (Or "She feels hot.")
*   _Il a froid._ — He is cold.
*   _Elle a deux ans._ — She is two years old.
*   _J'ai peur !_ — I am afraid!

French tends to use the verb _faire_ ("to do") idiomatically for general conditions like weather. Note that _il fait_ is an impersonal expression with no real subject, just like _il y a_ from "Common Phrases".

*   _Il fait chaud._ — It is hot (outside).
*   _Il fait froid._ — It is cold.
*   _Il fait nuit._ — It is nighttime.

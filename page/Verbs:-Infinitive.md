# Verbs: Infinitive

Verb conjugations are classified in two ways: **tense** and **mood**. Tenses reflect a time frame (e.g. present tense), while moods reflect a speaker's attitude. So far, you've mainly used the **indicative mood** (for facts and certainties), but it is only one of seven moods.

## The Infinitive Mood

The **infinitive mood** is an impersonal mood that isn't conjugated nor associated with any subject pronoun. It can be used in a variety of constructions, either with or without prepositions.

### Without Prepositions

Infinitives are often the objects of conjugated semi-auxiliary verbs such as _vouloir_, _pouvoir_, and _aimer_. You learned this in "Verbs: Present 1".

*   _Ça va **venir**._ — It is going to come.
*   _Je veux **danser**._ — I want to dance.
*   _J'aime **avoir** un chat._ — I like having a cat.

Infinitives can also act like nouns and can be used as subjects.

*   **_Faire_** _du café est facile._ — Making coffee is easy.
*   **_Cuisiner_** _et **nettoyer** sont ses responsabilités._ — Cooking and cleaning are his responsibilities.

Here, note that French infinitives can often be translated as English gerunds (with an -ing ending), especially when they're subjects.

### After Verbs + Prepositions

As you learned previously, some verbs must be followed by a preposition to complete their meaning (e.g. _penser à_). An infinitive can be used as a object when it follows such prepositions.

*   _Elle parle **de cuisiner** le poulet._ – She is talking about cooking the chicken.
*   _Je pense **à changer** de job._ – I am thinking about changing jobs.
*   _Je vous remercie **de laver** les verres._ – I thank you for washing the glasses.

Since infinitives can act like nouns, they can follow _être_ + _de_ to describe or define a subject (as a subject complement).

*   _Mon travail **est de cuisiner**._ – My job is to cook.
*   _L'objectif **est d'apprendre le francais**._ – The goal is to learn French.

The preposition _pour_ ("for" or "in order to") can come before an infinitive to express the purpose of an action.

*   _Je lis **pour apprendre**._ — I read [in order] to learn.
*   _Je viens **pour parler**._ — I am coming [in order] to talk.

Keep in mind that conjugated verbs should never come after prepositions.

### After Nouns

An infinitive can also modify a noun when used with _de_ or _à_. It may take practice to decide which preposition should be used, but in general, use _de_ whenever the infinitive has an object.

*   _Merci de laver les verres._ — Thanks for washing the glasses.
*   _Il prend le temps de manger une pomme._ — He takes the time to eat an apple.

Use _à_ when the verb in the sentence is _avoir_ (with the translation "to have").

*   _J'ai une décision à prendre._ — I have a decision to make.
*   _Il a un examen à préparer_ — He has an exam to prepare.

_À_ can also be used to indicate the purpose of a noun.

*   _une maison à vendre_ — a house for sale
*   _l'eau à boire_ — drinking water

### After Adjectives

Infinitives can be used with the construction _il est_ + adjective + _de_ to create impersonal expressions. Remember from "Common Phrases" that an impersonal statement is one with a dummy subject instead of a real one.

*   _Il est possible **de** manger maintenant._ — It is possible to eat now.
*   _Il est nécessaire de boire **de** l’eau._ — It is necessary to drink water.

However, if the subject _il_ is a real thing instead of just a dummy subject, then you must use _à_ instead of _de_.

*   _Cette tâche est facile **à** faire._ — This task is easy to do.
*   _C'est bon **à** savoir._ — That's good to know.

To further illustrate the difference, consider these two different translations of "It is fun to read." The first is a general statement, while the second is a statement about a real subject.

*   _Il est amusant de lire._ (Impersonal) — It is fun to read. / Reading is fun.
*   _Il est amusant à lire._ (Real) — It (e.g. a book) is fun to read.

## Causative Faire

_Faire_ often appears before a verb to indicate that the subject causes something to happen instead of performing it. It's often used in relation to foods.

*   _Il **fait bouillir** le thé._ — He boils the tea.
*   _J'aime **faire griller** du poulet._ — I like grilling chicken.

It can also be used to indicate that the subject has directed someone else to perform an action.

*   _Je le fais **réparer**._ — I am having it fixed.
*   _Je fais **partir** mon ami._ — I am making my friend leave.

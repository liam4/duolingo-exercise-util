## Noun Genders

One of the most difficult aspects of learning French is memorizing noun genders. However, by spending some time now memorizing the following patterns, you may be able to guess most nouns' genders and save yourself a lot of trouble in the future.

Some nouns, like _l'élève_ ("the student"), have the same spelling and meaning in both forms. Other nouns have the same spelling, but have different meanings. _Un tour_ is a tour, while _une tour_ is a tower. There are also nouns that only have one possible gender. Even a baby girl is _un bébé_, for instance. Many masculine nouns can be changed to a feminine form simply by adding an _-e_ to the end. Your male friend is _un ami_ and your female friend is _une amie_.

Some genders depend on a noun's classification. For instance, languages, days of the week, months, seasons, metals, colors, and measurements are mostly masculine.

Otherwise, memorizing word endings is the best way to guess genders. We'll learn these ending patterns in four steps:

**First:** Nouns ending in _-e_ tend to be feminine. All others, especially nouns ending in consonants, tend to be masculine. This is true for over 70% of all nouns.

**Second:** Nouns that have the endings _-ion_ and _-son_ tend to be feminine, even though they end in consonants.

**Third:** Some nouns ending in _-e_ are usually masculine, especially nouns with the following endings:

*   _-tre_, _-ble_, _-cle_ (think "treble clef")
*   _-one_, _-ème_, _-ège_ (think "OMG")
*   _-age_, _-isme_

**Fourth:** Watch out for these complications:

*   _-é_ is masculine, but _-té_ is feminine.
    *   _le résumé_ (masc) — the resumé
    *   _la liberté_ (fem) — the liberty
*   _-de_ is masculine, but _-ade_, _-nde_, and _-ude_ are feminine.
    *   _le guide_ — the guide
    *   _la parade_ — the parade
*   _-ste_ and _-me_ tend to be masculine, but there are dozens of exceptions. Words for people ending in _-ste_ are often gender-neutral, e.g. _le/la cycliste_.
*   _-eur_ is masculine for most professions or technical terms, but it's feminine for some emotions and abstract things.
    *   _le chauffeur_ — the driver
    *   _la peur_ — the fear

That's it! Memorize these, and you'll be able to guess most noun genders.

## Feminine Animals

In French, female animal nouns are generally formed as follows by taking the last consonant, doubling it, and adding a mute _-e_ to the end.

*   _un cha**t** ⇒ une cha**tte**_
*   _un chie**n** ⇒ une chie**nne**_

Of course, there are many exceptions. For example:

*   _un ours_ ⇒ _une ourse_ (not _une oursse_)
*   _un cheval_ ⇒ _une jument_ (not _une chevalle_)

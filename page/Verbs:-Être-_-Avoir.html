<h2>To Be and To Have</h2>
<p><em>Être</em> and <em>avoir</em> are the most common verbs in French. Like many common verbs, they have irregular conjugations.</p>

<p>There should be a liaison between <em>ils</em> or <em>elles</em> and <em>ont</em> ("il-zon" or "elle-zon"). The "z" sound is essential here to differentiate between "they are" and "they have", so be sure to emphasize it.</p>
<p>These two verbs are very important because they can act as <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong> in French, but they differ from their English equivalents. In "Basics 2", you learned that "I write" and "I am writing" both translate to <em>j'écris</em>, not <em>je suis écris</em>. This is because <em>être</em> cannot be used as an auxiliary in a simple tense. It can only be used in compound tenses, which you will learn in the "Passé Composé" unit.</p>
<p>Another important distinction is that <em>avoir</em> means "to have" in the sense of "to possess", but not "to consume" or "to experience". Other verbs must be used for these meanings.</p>
<h2><em>C'est</em> or <em>Il Est?</em></h2>
<p>When describing people and things with <em>être</em> in French, you usually can't use a personal subject pronoun like <em>elle</em>. Instead, you must use the impersonal pronoun <em>ce</em>, which can also mean "this" or "that". Note that <em>ce</em> is invariable, so it can never be <em>ces sont</em>.</p>

<p>These pronouns aren't interchangeable. The basic rule is that you must use <em>ce</em> when <em>être</em> is followed by any determiner—for instance, an article or a possessive adjective. Note that <em>c'est</em> should be used for singulars and <em>ce sont</em> should be used for plurals.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>C'est <strong>un</strong> homme.</em> — He's a man. / This is a man. / That is a man.</li>
<li><em>Ce sont <strong>des</strong> chats.</em> — They're cats. / These are cats. / Those are cats.</li>
<li><em>C'est <strong>mon</strong> chien.</em> — It's my dog. / This is my dog. / That's my dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an adjective, adverb, or both appear after <em>être</em>, then use the personal pronoun.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Elle est belle</em>. — She is beautiful. (Or "It is beautiful.")</li>
<li><em>Il est très fort.</em> — He is very strong. (Or "It is very strong.")</li>
</ul>
<p>As you know, nouns generally need determiners, but one important exception is that professions, nationalities, and religions can act as adjectives after <em>être</em>. This is optional; you can also choose to treat them as nouns.</p>
<ul>
<li>He is a doctor. — <em>Il est médecin.</em> / <em>C'est <strong>un</strong> médecin.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>However, <em>c'est</em> should be used when using an adjective to make a general comment about (but not describe) a thing or situation. In this case, use the masculine singular form of the adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>C'est normal ?</em> — Is this normal?</li>
<li><em>Non, c'est étrange.</em> — No, this is strange.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Idioms with <em>Avoir</em></h2>
<p>One of the most common idioms in French is the use of the verb <em>avoir</em> in certain places where English would use the verb "to be". This is especially common for states or conditions that a person may experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Elle a chaud.</em> — She is hot. (Or "She feels hot.")</li>
<li><em>Il a froid.</em> — He is cold.</li>
<li><em>Elle a deux ans.</em> — She is two years old.</li>
<li><em>J'ai peur !</em> — I am afraid!</li>
</ul>
<p>French tends to use the verb <em>faire</em> ("to do") idiomatically for general conditions like weather. Note that <em>il fait</em> is an impersonal expression with no real subject, just like <em>il y a</em> from "Common Phrases".</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il fait chaud.</em> — It is hot (outside).</li>
<li><em>Il fait froid.</em> — It is cold.</li>
<li><em>Il fait nuit.</em> — It is nighttime.</li>
</ul>

# Family

Adults should use _père_ and _mère_ when referring to parents. The juvenile forms, _papa_ and _maman_, are generally used only by children, much like "papa" and "mama" or "daddy" and "mommy" in English.

## Refresher: _C'est_ or _Il Est_?

You learned in "Être-Avoir" that you must often use the impersonal pronoun _ce_ when describing people and things with _être_. In general, use _ce_ whenever _être_ is followed by any determiner—for instance, an article or a possessive adjective. Remember that _ce_ is invariable, so use _c'est_ for singulars and _ce sont_ for plurals.

*   _C'est **un** homme._ — He's a man.
*   _Ce sont **des** chats._ — They're cats.
*   _C'est **mon** chien._ — It's my dog.

This rule applies everywhere, including in questions, inversions, and subordinate clauses.

*   _C'est un animal ?_ — That's an animal?
*   _Est-ce votre petit-fils ?_ — Is he your grandson?
*   _Vous l'aimez parce que c'est votre fils._ — You love him because he is your son.

The personal pronoun _il_ should only be used with _être_ when they're followed by an adjective and/or adverb.

*   Il est fort. — He is strong.
*   Est-elle forte ? — Is she strong?
*   Est-ce qu'il est content ? — Is he happy?

In the last example, note that _est-ce_ still appears because _est-ce que_ is a fixed impersonal phrase.

<p>Grammar notes like those below can be helpful if you're having trouble with the lessons, so consider trying the lessons above before reading the notes. They'll be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them.</p>
<h2>Plurals</h2>
<p>Many French words have plural forms. Plural nouns and adjectives often end in <em>-s</em>, though the S is usually silent.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>homme</em> ("man") ⇒ <em>hommes</em> ("men")</li>
<li><em>femme</em> ("woman") ⇒ <em>femmes</em> ("women")</li>
<li><em>chat noir</em> ("black cat") ⇒ <em>chats noirs</em> ("black cats")</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also plural forms for pronouns and verb conjugations. Consider <em>parler</em> ("to speak"):</p>

<h2><em>Tu</em> or <em>Vous</em>?</h2>
<p>French has two words for the subject pronoun "you": <strong><em>tu</em></strong> and <strong><em>vous</em></strong>. For a singular "you", <em>tu</em> should only be used for friends, peers, relatives, children, or anyone else who's very familiar to you. In all other cases and also for plurals, the more polite <em>vous</em> should be used to show respect. When in doubt, use <em>vous</em>.</p>
<h2>Agreement</h2>
<p>Pronouns, adjectives, and articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. Consider the examples below and note how the article and adjective change to agree with each noun.</p>
<ul>
<li>Masculine singular: <em>Le chat noir</em> — The black cat</li>
<li>Masculine plural: <em>Les chats noirs</em> — The black cats</li>
<li>Feminine singular: <em>La robe noire</em> — The black dress</li>
<li>Feminine plural: <em>Les robes noires</em> — The black dresses</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all adjectives change forms. For instance, <em>riche</em> is the same for both masculine and feminine singular nouns.</p>
<h2>Continuous Tenses</h2>
<p>English has two present tenses: <strong>simple</strong> ("I write") and <strong>continuous</strong> ("I am writing"), but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses. This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to <em>j'écris</em> (not <em>je suis écris</em>) and vice versa.</p>
<p>However, the idiomatic phrase <em>« être en train de »</em> is often used to indicate that someone is in the process of doing something.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je suis en train de manger.</em> — I am [in the process of] eating.</li>
</ul>
<p>When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms. For instance, <em>« j'aime un garçon »</em> cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".</p>
<h2>Ah, <em>L'Amour</em></h2>
<p>Love is tricky in France. For people and pets, <em>aimer</em> means "to love", but if you add an adverb, like in <em>aimer bien</em>, it means "to like". For everything else, <em>aimer</em> only means "to like". <em>Adorer</em> can always mean "to love", though it tends to be more coy than <em>aimer</em>.</p>

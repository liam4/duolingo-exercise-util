# Prepositions 1

Congratulations on passing the second checkpoint!

French prepositions can be difficult because their meanings and uses don't always line up to what you would expect in English.

### _De_ and _À_

The most common French prepositions are **_de_** ("of"/"from") and **_à_** ("to"/"at"). These prepositions can be used in many ways. For instance, they may indicate movement or location.

*   _Nous allons **à** Paris._ — We are going to Paris.
*   _Il vient **de** Bordeaux._ — He is coming from Bordeaux.
*   _Je suis **au** restaurant._ — I am at the restaurant.

Notice _au_ above. _De_ and _à_ must contract with definite articles whenever they are adjacent.

<td>la</td>

<td>de la</td>

<td>à la</td>

<tr>

<td>les</td>

<td>des</td>

<td>aux</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

If the contraction is followed by a vowel sound, _du_ and _de la_ both become _de l'_ and _au_ and _à la_ both become _à l'_. This change occurs for euphony only; the nouns do not change genders because of it.

*   _Tu parles **à l'**enfant._ (Not _au_) — You are speaking to the child.
*   _La Maison **de l'**Ours_ — The House of the Bear
*   _Les copies **des** livres._ — The copies of the books.
*   _Le repas **du** chien._ — The dog's meal. (The meal of the dog.)

_De_ may be found in numerous fixed expressions, especially in adverbs of quantity like _beaucoup de_ ("a lot of").

*   _Nous avons beaucoup **de** pommes._ — We have a lot of apples.
*   _Rémy a beaucoup **d'**amis._ — Remy has a lot of friends.

Adding _de_ or _à_ to the end of certain verbs can change their meanings.

*   _Penser_ ("to think"): _Je pense que c'est un homme._ — I think that he is a man.
*   _Penser **à**_ ("to think about"): _Elle pense à son chien._ — She's thinking about her dog.
*   _Penser **de**_ ("to opine about"): _Que pensez-vous de ce repas ?_ — What do you think of this meal?

### Using Articles After _De_

Most articles can be used immediately after expressions and verbs ending in _de_, but they must follow contraction and elision rules.

*   _Elle parle beaucoup **des** (de + les) pâtes._ — She speaks a lot about **the** pasta.
*   _Que pensez-vous de **la** voiture ?_ — What do you think of **the** car?
*   _Il a besoin d'**un** chien._ — He needs **a** dog.

However, no article that already contains _de_ may follow an expression, negative term, or verb ending in _de_. This includes the partitives _du_ and _de la_ and the indefinite _des_. In this situation, the article is removed so that only the naked _de_ remains.

*   _Elle mange beaucoup **de** frites._ (Not _de des_) — She eats a lot of fries.
*   _Je n'ai pas **de** pain._ (Not _de du_) — I do not have (any) bread.
*   _Il a besoin **d'**argent (Not_ de de l'**) — He needs (some) money.

### _Des_ Before Adjectives

When _des_ appears immediately before an adjective, it changes to _de_. This only occurs with BANGS adjectives, which come before the noun.

*   _Vous êtes **de** jeunes garçons._ — You are young boys.
*   _Elle a **de** petits chiens._ — She has small dogs.

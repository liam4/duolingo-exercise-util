# Possessives

## Possessives Match What is Owned

In English, **possessive adjectives** (e.g. "his") match the owner. However, in French, they match the thing being owned.

Consider the example of "her lion". The French translation is _son lion_, because lion is masculine and both the lion and the woman are singular. Note that if we hear just _son lion_, we can't tell if the lion is owned by a man or woman. It's ambiguous without more context. If two people own a lion, then it is _leur lion_.

Possessives have different forms that agree with four things: the number of owners, the number of things owned, the gender of the thing owned, and the grammatical person of the owner (e.g. "his" versus "my").

For one owner, the possessive adjectives are:

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Person</th>

<th>English</th>

<th>Masculine Singular</th>

<th>Feminine Singular</th>

<th>Plural</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>1st</td>

<td>my</td>

<td>mon</td>

<td>ma</td>

<td>mes</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>2nd</td>

<td>your (singular)</td>

<td>ton</td>

<td>ta</td>

<td>tes</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>3rd</td>

<td>his/her/its</td>

<td>son</td>

<td>sa</td>

<td>ses</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

For multiple owners, genders don't matter:

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Person</th>

<th>English</th>

<th>Singular Owned</th>

<th>Plural Owned</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>1st</td>

<td>our</td>

<td>notre</td>

<td>nos</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>2nd</td>

<td>your (plural)</td>

<td>votre</td>

<td>vos</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>3rd</td>

<td>their</td>

<td>leur</td>

<td>leurs</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

The plural second-person possessive adjectives, _votre_ and _vos_, should be used when addressing someone formally with _vous_.

Examples:

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Owner</th>

<th>Singular Owned</th>

<th>Plural Owned</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>My</td>

<td>_Mon ami_ — My friend</td>

<td>_Mes tigres_ — My tigers</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Your</td>

<td>_Ton abeille_ — Your bee</td>

<td>_Tes lions_ — Your lions</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>His/Her</td>

<td>_Son oiseau_ — His/her bird</td>

<td>_Ses chiens_ — His/her dogs</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Our</td>

<td>_Notre bière_ — Our beer</td>

<td>_Nos pommes_ — Our apples</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Your</td>

<td>_Votre sel_ — Your salt</td>

<td>_Vos citrons_ — Your lemons</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Their</td>

<td>_Leur fromage_ — Their cheese</td>

<td>_Leurs fromages_ — Their cheeses</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

## Euphony in Possessives

For the sake of euphony, all singular feminine possessives switch to their masculine forms when followed by a vowel sound.

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Person</th>

<th>Masculine</th>

<th>Feminine</th>

<th>Feminine + Vowel Sound</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>1st</td>

<td>mon chat</td>

<td>ma robe</td>

<td>mon eau</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>2nd</td>

<td>ton chat</td>

<td>ta robe</td>

<td>ton eau</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>3rd</td>

<td>son chat</td>

<td>sa robe</td>

<td>son eau</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

## Femme and Fille

_Femme_ can mean "woman" or "wife" and _fille_ can mean "girl" or "daughter" depending on the context. For example, when _femme_ and _fille_ are preceded by a possessive adjective, then they translate to "wife" and "daughter", respectively.

*   _Une fille et une femme sont dans le restaurant_ — A girl and a woman are in the restaurant. (Not: "A daughter and a wife are in the restaurant.")
*   _Ma fille_ — My daughter. (Not: "My girl".)
*   _Ta femme_ — Your wife. (Not: "Your woman".)

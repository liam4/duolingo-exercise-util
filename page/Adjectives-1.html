<h2>Agreement</h2>
<p>Unlike English adjectives, French adjectives must agree in number and gender with the nouns that they modify. A black dog is <em>un chien noir</em>, but a black dress is <em>une robe noire</em>. Also, remember that some adjectives have the same masculine and feminine form, especially those ending in a silent <em>-e</em> (e.g. <em>riche</em>).</p>
<p>When used with pronouns, adjectives agree with the noun that has been replaced. This is particularly tricky with the formal <em>vous</em>: to a singular man, you would say <em>vous êtes beau</em>, but to plural women, you would say <em>vous êtes belles</em>.</p>
<h2>Adjective Placement</h2>
<p>In French, most adjectives appear after the nouns they modify. For instance, <em>le chat noir</em>. However, some adjectives precede the noun. You can remember these types of nouns using the mnemonic <strong>BANGS</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B</strong> is for beauty. <em>Une belle femme</em>  — A beautiful woman</li>
<li><strong>A</strong> is for age. <em>Une jeune fille</em> — A young girl</li>
<li><strong>N</strong> is for number. <em>Deux hommes</em> — Two men<ul>
<li>This can also be for rank: <em>Le premier mot</em> — The first word</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> is for good or bad. <em>Un bon garçon</em> — A good boy</li>
<li><strong>S</strong> is for size. <em>Un gros chat</em> — A fat cat</li>
</ul>
<p>All determiner adjectives (e.g. possessives, interrogatives, and demonstratives) appear before the noun, e.g. <em>mon livre</em> ("my book") and <em>ce cochon</em> ("that pig"). You will learn these later.</p>
<h2>Figurative Adjectives</h2>
<p>A few adjectives can come both before and after the noun depending on their meaning. The most common example is <em>grand</em>, which is a BANGS adjective for everything but people. For people, it comes before a noun when it means "important" and after the noun when it means "tall". For instance, Napoleon was <em>un grand homme</em> ("a great man"), but not <em>un homme grand</em> ("a tall man").</p>
<p>Usually, figurative meanings will precede the noun, while literal meanings will follow the noun.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>un <strong>pauvre</strong> homme</em> — a pitiful man</li>
<li><em>un homme <strong>pauvre</strong></em> — a poor man</li>
<li><em>un <strong>certain</strong> nombre</em> — a certain (particular) number</li>
<li><em>une victoire <strong>certaine</strong></em> — a certain (guaranteed) victory</li>
<li><em>ma <strong>propre</strong> voiture</em> — my own car</li>
<li><em>ma voiture <strong>propre</strong></em> — my clean car</li>
<li><em>un <strong>cher</strong> ami</em> — a dear friend</li>
<li><em>une montre <strong>chère</strong></em> — an expensive watch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Euphony</h2>
<p>As you have already learned, elisions, contractions, liaisons, and enchaînements are all designed to prevent consecutive vowel sounds (which is called <strong>hiatus</strong>). This quest for harmonious sounds is called <strong>euphony</strong> and is an essential feature of French. It has, however, created some unexpected rules.</p>
<p>For instance, the masculine <em>beau</em> ("beautiful") changes to <em>bel</em> if its noun begins with a vowel sound. A beautiful man is <em>un bel homme</em>. The other two common changes are <em>vieux</em> to <em>vieil</em> ("old") and <em>nouveau</em> to <em>nouvel</em> ("new").</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't occur to feminine adjectives because they usually end in silent vowels.</p>

# Common Phrases

Grammar notes like those below can be helpful if you're having trouble with the lessons, so consider trying the lessons above before reading the notes. They'll be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them.

## _Bonjour!_

_Bonjour_ is a universal greeting that can be spoken to anyone at any time. In France, greeting people is very important, and some will even say _bonjour_ aloud when entering a public room or bus. _Bon après-midi_ is often used as a farewell in the afternoon, while _bonsoir_ is an evening greeting.

*   Greetings: _bonjour_, _bonsoir_ (plus _bon matin_ in Québec only)
*   Farewells: _bonne journée_, _bon après-midi_, _bonne soirée_, _bonne nuit_

## Idioms

Many words or phrases cannot be translated literally between English and French because their usages are idiomatic. For instance, consider _« Ça va ? »_, which means "How are you?" The literal translation of the French is "That goes?", but this is nonsensical in English. It is very important to identify idioms in both languages and learn how to translate them properly.

## Liaisons

In a **liaison**, an otherwise silent ending consonant is pushed to the next word, where it's pronounced as part of the first syllable. Like elisions, this prevents consecutive vowel sounds. Liaisons are possible whenever a silent ending consonant is followed by a word beginning in a vowel sound, but some liaisons are mandatory and others are forbidden.

Here are some mandatory liaisons, along with approximate pronunciations:

*   Articles and adjectives with nouns. For example, _un homme_ ("uh-nohm"), _mon orange_ ("mohn-norahnge"), or _deux hommes_ ("duh-zohm").
*   Pronouns and verbs. For example, _nous allons_ ("noo-zalohn") or _est-il_ ("ay-teel").
*   Single-syllable adverbs and prepositions. For instance, _très utile_ ("tray-zuteel") or _chez elle_ ("shay-zell").

Liaisons are forbidden:

*   Before and after _et_ ("and").
*   After singular nouns (including proper nouns and names).
*   After inversions (which you'll learn in "Questions").
*   Before an aspirated H (e.g. _héros_ - "hero").
*   After a nasal sound, except that _un_, _on_, and _en_ do liaise.

Note that some consonants take on a different sound in liaisons to reduce ambiguity.

There are no ironclad liaison rules, especially across regions. Casual speech tends to have fewer than formal speech. Also, when speaking slowly, liaisons are often omitted. This is why liaisons disappear in the slow versions of listening exercises. Be careful of this.

## Enchaînement

In **enchaînements**, ending consonant sounds are pushed onto the next word if it begins in a vowel. This is essentially the same as a liaison, except that the consonant sound wasn't silent beforehand. For instance:

*   _elle est_ is pronounced like "eh-lay".
*   _mange une pomme_ is pronounced like "mahn-jun-pom".

## The Impersonal Expression _Il Y A_

**Impersonal expressions** are phrases where there isn't a real subject. For instance, in the phrase "It is snowing" (_Il neige_), "it" doesn't refer to anything. It's a dummy subject that exists just to maintain the sentence structure.

One of the most common impersonal expressions is _il y a_, which is an idiom for "there is" or "there are".

*   _Il y a une fille ici._ — There is a girl here.
*   _Il y a un serpent dans ma botte !_ — There's a snake in my boot!

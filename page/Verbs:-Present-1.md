# Verbs: Present 1

## Conjugations and Infinitives

As you learned in "Basics 1", verbs like _parler_ conjugate to agree with their subjects. _Parler_ itself is an _infinitive_, which is a verb's base form. It consists of a root (_parl-_) and an ending (_-er_). The ending can dictate how the verb should be conjugated. In this case, almost all verbs ending in _-er_ are **regular verbs** in the **1st Group** that share the same conjugation pattern. To conjugate another 1st Group verb, affix the ending to that verb's root.

*   _Aimer_ ("to love"): _j'aim**e**, tu aim**es**, nous aim**ons**,_ etc.
*   _Marcher_ ("to walk"): _je march**e**, tu march**es**, nous march**ons**,_ etc.

Every verb belongs to one of three groups:

*   The **1st Group** includes regular _-er_ verbs and includes 80% of all verbs.
*   The **2nd Group** includes regular _-ir_ verbs like _finir_ ('to finish").
*   The **3rd Group** includes all irregular verbs. This includes many common verbs like _être_ and _avoir_ as well as a handful of less common conjugation patterns.

_Aller_ ("to go") is the only fully irregular verb in Group 1, but a handful of others are slightly irregular.

**Spelling-changing** verbs end in _-ger_ (e.g. _manger_) or _-cer_ (e.g. _lancer_, "to throw") and change slightly in the _nous_ form, as well as any other form whose ending begins with an A or O. These verbs take a form like _nous mangeons_ or _nous lançons_.

**Stem-changing** verbs have different roots in their _nous_ and _vous_ forms. For instance, most forms of _appeler_ ("to call") have two L's (e.g. _j'appelle_), but the N/V forms are _nous appelons_ and _vous appelez_.

## Semi-Auxiliary Verbs

The only true auxiliary verbs in French are _être_ and _avoir_, but there are a number of **semi-auxiliary verbs** in French that can be used with other verbs to express ability, necessity, desire, and so on. They are used in **double-verb constructions** where the first verb (the semi-auxiliary) is conjugated and the second is not.

*   _Je veux lire._ — I want to read.
*   _Il aime manger._ — He likes to eat.

Modal verbs are the English equivalents of semi-auxiliaries—for instance, "can", which translates to either _savoir_ or _pouvoir_. When "can" indicates knowledge, use _savoir_.

*   _Je sais lire et écrire._ — I know how to read and write.
*   _Il sait parler allemand._ — He knows how to speak German.

When "can" indicates permission or ability (apart from knowledge), use _pouvoir_.

*   _Il peut manger._ — He can (or "may") eat.
*   _Il peut parler allemand._ — He is allowed to speak German.

One of the most important semi-auxiliary verbs is _aller_, which is used to express the near future (_futur proche_), just like the English verb "going to".

*   _Je vais manger._ — I am going to eat.
*   _Vous allez lire le livre._ — You are going to read the book.

Note that in verb constructions beginning with non-auxiliary verbs, the verbs must be separated by a preposition.

*   _Nous vivons pour manger._ — We live to eat.

## Impersonal Expressions

A few defective **impersonal verbs** can only be used in impersonal statements and must be conjugated as third-person singular with _il_. Remember that _il_ is a dummy subject and does not refer to a person.

**_Falloir_** means "to be necessary", and it often takes the form _il faut_ + infinitive.

*   _Il faut manger._ — It is necessary to eat. / One must eat.
*   _Il faut choisir._ — It is necessary to choose. / One must choose.

**_Il faut_** can also be used transitively with a noun to indicate that it is needed.

*   _Il faut du pain._ — (Some) bread is needed.

## Confusing Verbs

Used transitively, **_savoir_** and **_connaître_** both mean "to know", but in different ways. _Savoir_ implies understanding of subjects, things, or skills, while _connaître_ indicates familiarity with people, animals, places, things, or situations.

*   _Je sais les mots._ — I know the words.
*   _Je connais le garçon._ — I know the boy.

**_Attendre_** means "to await", which is why it does not need a preposition.

*   Il attend son ami. — He is awaiting (or "waiting for") his friend.

## One Each

The indefinite article doesn't always refer to just one thing. Sometimes, it can mean one thing each. Consider these examples:

*   _Ils ont un manteau_ — They have one coat / They **each** have one coat
*   _Ils ont des manteaux_ — They have some coats / They **each** have some coats

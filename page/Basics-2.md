# Basics 2

Grammar notes like those below can be helpful if you're having trouble with the lessons, so consider trying the lessons above before reading the notes. They'll be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them.

## Plurals

Many French words have plural forms. Plural nouns and adjectives often end in _-s_, though the S is usually silent.

*   _homme_ ("man") ⇒ _hommes_ ("men")
*   _femme_ ("woman") ⇒ _femmes_ ("women")
*   _chat noir_ ("black cat") ⇒ _chats noirs_ ("black cats")

There are also plural forms for pronouns and verb conjugations. Consider _parler_ ("to speak"):

## _Tu_ or _Vous_?

French has two words for the subject pronoun "you": **_tu_** and **_vous_**. For a singular "you", _tu_ should only be used for friends, peers, relatives, children, or anyone else who's very familiar to you. In all other cases and also for plurals, the more polite _vous_ should be used to show respect. When in doubt, use _vous_.

## Agreement

Pronouns, adjectives, and articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. Consider the examples below and note how the article and adjective change to agree with each noun.

*   Masculine singular: _Le chat noir_ — The black cat
*   Masculine plural: _Les chats noirs_ — The black cats
*   Feminine singular: _La robe noire_ — The black dress
*   Feminine plural: _Les robes noires_ — The black dresses

Not all adjectives change forms. For instance, _riche_ is the same for both masculine and feminine singular nouns.

## Continuous Tenses

English has two present tenses: **simple** ("I write") and **continuous** ("I am writing"), but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses. This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to _j'écris_ (not _je suis écris_) and vice versa.

However, the idiomatic phrase _« être en train de »_ is often used to indicate that someone is in the process of doing something.

*   _Je suis en train de manger._ — I am [in the process of] eating.

When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms. For instance, _« j'aime un garçon »_ cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".

## Ah, _L'Amour_

Love is tricky in France. For people and pets, _aimer_ means "to love", but if you add an adverb, like in _aimer bien_, it means "to like". For everything else, _aimer_ only means "to like". _Adorer_ can always mean "to love", though it tends to be more coy than _aimer_.

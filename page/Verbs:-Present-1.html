<h2>Conjugations and Infinitives</h2>
<p>As you learned in "Basics 1", verbs like <em>parler</em> conjugate to agree with their subjects. <em>Parler</em> itself is an <em>infinitive</em>, which is a verb's base form. It consists of a root (<em>parl-</em>) and an ending (<em>-er</em>). The ending can dictate how the verb should be conjugated. In this case, almost all verbs ending in <em>-er</em> are <strong>regular verbs</strong> in the <strong>1st Group</strong> that share the same conjugation pattern. To conjugate another 1st Group verb, affix the ending to that verb's root.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Aimer</em> ("to love"): <em>j'aim<strong>e</strong>, tu aim<strong>es</strong>, nous aim<strong>ons</strong>,</em> etc.</li>
<li><em>Marcher</em> ("to walk"): <em>je march<strong>e</strong>, tu march<strong>es</strong>, nous march<strong>ons</strong>,</em> etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Every verb belongs to one of three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>1st Group</strong> includes regular <em>-er</em> verbs and includes 80% of all verbs.</li>
<li>The <strong>2nd Group</strong> includes regular <em>-ir</em> verbs like <em>finir</em> ('to finish").</li>
<li>The <strong>3rd Group</strong> includes all irregular verbs. This includes many common verbs like <em>être</em> and <em>avoir</em> as well as a handful of less common conjugation patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Aller</em> ("to go") is the only fully irregular verb in Group 1, but a handful of others are slightly irregular.</p>
<p><strong>Spelling-changing</strong> verbs end in <em>-ger</em> (e.g. <em>manger</em>) or <em>-cer</em> (e.g. <em>lancer</em>, "to throw") and change slightly in the <em>nous</em> form, as well as any other form whose ending begins with an A or O. These verbs take a form like <em>nous mangeons</em> or <em>nous lançons</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Stem-changing</strong> verbs have different roots in their <em>nous</em> and <em>vous</em> forms. For instance,  most forms of <em>appeler</em> ("to call") have two L's (e.g. <em>j'appelle</em>), but the N/V forms are <em>nous appelons</em> and <em>vous appelez</em>. </p>
<h2>Semi-Auxiliary Verbs</h2>
<p>The only true auxiliary verbs in French are <em>être</em> and <em>avoir</em>, but there are a number of <strong>semi-auxiliary verbs</strong> in French that can be used with other verbs to express ability, necessity, desire, and so on. They are used in <strong>double-verb constructions</strong> where the first verb (the semi-auxiliary) is conjugated and the second is not.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je veux lire.</em> — I want to read.</li>
<li><em>Il aime manger.</em> — He likes to  eat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modal verbs are the English equivalents of semi-auxiliaries—for instance, "can", which translates to either <em>savoir</em> or <em>pouvoir</em>. When "can" indicates knowledge, use <em>savoir</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je sais lire et écrire.</em> — I know how to read and write.</li>
<li><em>Il sait parler allemand.</em> — He knows how to speak German.</li>
</ul>
<p>When "can" indicates permission or ability (apart from knowledge), use <em>pouvoir</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il peut manger.</em> — He can (or "may") eat.</li>
<li><em>Il peut parler allemand.</em> — He is allowed to speak German.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important semi-auxiliary verbs is <em>aller</em>, which is used to express the near future (<em>futur proche</em>), just like the English verb "going to". </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je vais manger.</em> — I am going to eat.</li>
<li><em>Vous allez lire le livre.</em> — You are going to read the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in verb constructions beginning with non-auxiliary verbs, the verbs must be separated by a preposition.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Nous vivons pour manger.</em> — We live to eat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impersonal Expressions</h2>
<p>A few defective <strong>impersonal verbs</strong> can only be used in impersonal statements and must be conjugated as third-person singular with <em>il</em>. Remember that <em>il</em> is a dummy subject and does not refer to a person.</p>
<p><strong><em>Falloir</em></strong> means "to be necessary", and it often takes the form <em>il faut</em> + infinitive.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il faut manger.</em> — It is necessary to eat. / One must eat.</li>
<li><em>Il faut choisir.</em> — It is necessary to choose. / One must choose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Il faut</em></strong> can also be used transitively with a noun to indicate that it is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Il faut du pain.</em> — (Some) bread is needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Confusing Verbs</h2>
<p>Used transitively, <strong><em>savoir</em></strong> and <strong><em>connaître</em></strong> both mean "to know", but in different ways. <em>Savoir</em> implies understanding of subjects, things, or skills, while <em>connaître</em> indicates familiarity with people, animals, places, things, or situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Je sais les mots.</em> — I know the words.</li>
<li><em>Je connais le garçon.</em> — I know the boy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Attendre</em></strong> means "to await", which is why it does not need a preposition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Il attend son ami. — He is awaiting (or "waiting for") his friend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>One Each</h2>
<p>The indefinite article doesn't always refer to just one thing. Sometimes, it can mean one thing each. Consider these examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ils ont un manteau</em> — They have one coat / They <strong>each</strong> have one coat</li>
<li><em>Ils ont des manteaux</em> — They have some coats / They <strong>each</strong> have some coats</li>
</ul>

# Numbers 1

Between 0 and 20, most French numbers are constructed similarly to English numbers. The main difference is that French starts using compound numbers at _dix-sept_ (17), while English continues with single-word numbers until 21.

## Uses of _Un_

The word _un_ (or _une_ in feminine) can be used in a number of ways:

1.  As an indefinite article ("a" or "an"), which is used to modify countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers.
    *   _un livre_ — a book
    *   _un éléphant_ — an elephant
2.  As a numeral ("one"), which is a kind of adjective.
    *   _J'ai une seule question._ — I have only one question.
3.  As a pronoun ("one"). Like in English, French numbers can be used as pronouns. In general, when you see a preposition like _de_ after a number, that number acts as a pronoun.
    *   _C'est un de mes enfants._ — He is one of my children.
    *   _Je connais un de ces hommes._ — I know one of those men.

Also, keep in mind that liaisons are forbidden before and after _et_.

# Dates and time

## The Close Future

In French, the present tense can often be used to describe something that will happen soon.

*   _Je vous appelle demain._ — I [will] call you tomorrow.
*   _On se voit demain._ — We [will] see each other tomorrow.

This also occurs in English, albeit less frequently.

*   _Ça commence demain._ — That begins tomorrow.

## Describing Dates

The most formal way to express a date in French is with _c'est_. (Never use _il est_.)

*   _C'est dimanche._ — It's Sunday.

However, the most common way is to use _nous sommes_ or _on est_. This construction is idiomatic and does not directly translate to English.

*   _Nous sommes vendredi._ — It is Friday.
*   _Aujourd'hui, on est mardi._ — Today is Tuesday.

Note that while "today" is a noun and adverb in English, _aujourd'hui_ cannot be used as a noun to give a date, so you cannot say _Aujourd'hui est mardi_. However, _hier_, _aujourd'hui_, and _demain_ can be used as nouns when qualified by an adjective or another noun.

*   _Demain est un autre jour._ — Tomorrow is another day.
*   _Hier était férié._ — Yesterday was a holiday.

This construction can be used to express the month, though you must add _en_. Months aren't capitalized in French.

*   _Nous sommes en juillet._ — It's July.

When denoting specific dates, put _le_ and the date before the month. Also, French date abbreviations take the form DD/MM/YY.

*   27/11/14 — _C'est le 27 novembre 2014._ — It's November 27, 2014.
*   02/10 — _Nous sommes le 2 octobre._ — It's October 2nd.

However, for the first day of the month, you must use the word _premier_.

*   01/04 — _C'est le premier avril._ — It's April 1st.

To express a relative time in the past, you can use _il y a_.

*   _il y a huit jours_ — eight days ago
*   _il y a deux ans_ — two years ago

## _Jour_ or _Journée_?

A few words for dates and times have both masculine and feminine forms that are used in different contexts.

Consider the meaning of the whole sentence when deciding between the two. Some pairs are more flexible than others. _Jour_ and _journée_ can often be interchangeable, but _matin_ and _matinée_ are very strictly separate.

The masculine forms are used for countable units of time and specific dates or moments. For instance:

*   With numerals (except _un_ in some cases).
    *   _deux ans_ — two years
    *   _trois jours_ — three days
*   With _tous_ ("all"), _chaque_ ("every"), and _ce_ ("this"/"that").
    *   _chaque matin / tous les matins_ — every morning
*   With temporal adverbs (e.g. _demain_ and _hier_).
    *   _demain matin_ — tomorrow morning
    *   _hier soir_ — yesterday evening / last night

The feminine forms are used to express or emphasize a duration or the passing of time. They're also used with most adjectives. For instance:

*   When emphasizing a duration.
    *   _Je vais lire toute la matinée._ — I am going to read all morning.
    *   _la journée de 8 heures_ — the 8-hour day
*   With adjectives (except _tous/chaque/ce_).
    *   _une belle soirée_ — a beautiful evening
    *   _Cette année est mémorable._ — This year is memorable.

Deciding between forms with _un_ depends on whether _un_ acts as a numeral or article. If you can translate _un_ as "one" in English, then go with the masculine.

Notice that _chaque matin_ doesn't require an article but _tous les matins_ does. This is because _chaque_, _ce_, and articles are all examples of determiners, which are words that give context to nouns.You will learn more about determiners in "Adjectives 3".

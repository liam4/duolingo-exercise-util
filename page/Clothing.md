## Idiomatic Plurals

English has a number of idiomatic plural-only nouns that have to be translated carefully. These are not just nouns that are invariable with number (like "deer"), but rather nouns that cannot refer to a singular thing at all.

For instance, "the pants" can only be plural in English, but the corresponding _le pantalon_ is singular in French. A single pair of pants is not _les pantalons_, which refers to multiple pairs of pants. Similarly, when translating _le pantalon_ back to English, you can say "the pants" or "a pair of pants", but "a pant" is not correct. This also applies to _un jean_ ("a pair of jeans").

_Un vêtement_ refers to a single article of clothing, and it's incorrect to translate it as "clothes", which is plural and refers to a collection of clothing. This would have to be _des vêtements_.

## Diacritics

**The acute accent** **(é)** only appears on E and produces a pure [e] that isn't found in English. To make this sound, say the word "cliché", but hold your tongue perfectly still on the last vowel to avoid making a diphthong sound.

**The grave accent** **(è)** can appear on A/E/U, though it only changes the sound for E (to [ɛ], which is the E in "lemon"). Otherwise, it distinguishes homophones like _a_ (a conjugated form of _avoir_) and _à_ (a preposition).

**The cedilla** **(ç)** softens a normally hard C sound to the soft C in "cent". Otherwise, a C followed by an A, O, or U has a hard sound like the C in "car".

**The circumflex** **(ê)** usually means that an S used to follow the vowel in Old French or Latin. (The same is true of the acute accent.) For instance, _île_ was once "isle".

**The trema** **(ë)** indicates that two adjacent vowels must be pronounced separately, like in _Noël_ ("Christmas") and _maïs_ ("corn").

## Nasal Vowels

There are four nasal vowels in French. Try to learn these sounds by listening to native speakers.

These aren't always nasalized. If there's a double M or N, or if they are followed by any vowel, then the vowel should have an oral sound instead. For instance, _un_ is nasal, but _une_ is not. Also, _vin_ is nasal, but _vinaigre_ is not.

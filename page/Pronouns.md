# Pronouns

## _On_

**_On_** is a versatile and ubiquitous French indefinite subject pronoun. Francophones usually say _on_ to refer to "us", "them", or one or more unidentified persons. _On_ is always masculine and third-person singular, which is why conjugation charts often list _il/elle/on_ together.

*   _On mange._ — We are eating.
*   _On est seul._ (Never _On est seule/seuls/seules._) — We are alone.

_On_ can also be used more formally in the passive voice or for general statements, much like the English "one".

*   _On doit dormir assez._ — One must sleep adequately.

## Direct Object Pronouns

As you learned in "Verbs: Present 2", **direct objects** are things that are directly acted upon by a verb. For instance, in the sentence "Ben threw the ball", the ball is the direct object. French has a set of pronouns that can be used to refer to a direct object.

Direct object pronouns usually come before their verbs.

*   _L'enfant **me** voit._ — The child sees **me**.
*   _Le lion **le** mange._ — The lion eats **it** (or "him"!).
*   _Vous **nous** aimez._ — You love **us**.
*   _Je **t**'aime._ — I love **you**.

_Me_/_te_/_le_/_la_ elide, so make sure you notice them when they hide in the first syllable of a verb.

*   _Elle **m**'attend._ — She is waiting for me.
*   _L'enfant **l**'appelle._ — The child calls to him (or "her").

_Le_ and _les_ only contract when they're articles, not when they're object pronouns.

*   _Je suis en train de le faire._ (Not _du faire_) — I am in the process of doing it.

## _En_ Replaces _De_ + Noun

The adverbial pronoun **_en_** can be used to replace objects introduced by _de_. For instance, it can replace a partitive article + noun.

*   _Avez-vous **de l'argent** ?_ — Do you have some money?
*   _Oui, j'**en** ai._ — Yes, I have some.

_En_ may replace nouns or pronouns in verb constructions that use _de_, like _parler de_ ("to talk about").

*   _Marc parle **de Peter** ?_ — Is Marc talking about Peter?
*   _Oui, il **en** parle._ — Yep, he's talking about him.

Nouns in adverbs of quantity can also be replaced with _en_.

*   _Achetez-vous beaucoup **de livres** ?_ — Are you buying a lot of books?
*   _Oui, j'**en** achète beaucoup._ — Yes, I am buying a lot [of them].

Notice that _en_ always precedes the verb, but adverbs stay in place after the verb.

## _Y_ Can Refer to a Place

The adverbial pronoun **_y_** can refer to a previously mentioned or implied place, in which case it's usually translated as "there".

*   _Allez-vous au restaurant ?_ — Are you going to the restaurant?
*   _Oui, j'**y** vais_. — Yes, I'm going there.

In English, "there" may be omitted, but the same is not true of _y_ in French. _Je vais_ is not a complete sentence without _y_.

## The Relative Pronouns _Que_ and _Qui_

**Relative pronouns** introduce relative clauses, which are subordinate clauses that elaborate upon a previously mentioned noun (the **antecedent**). Use _que_ when the relative pronoun is the direct object ("whom" in English) and use _qui_ when it's the subject ("who" in English).

*   _C'est l'homme **que** je connais._ — He's the man whom (or "that") I know.
*   _La fille **qui** lit un menu._ — The girl who (or "that") reads a menu.

If you have trouble figuring out whether to use _qui_ or _que_, try rephrasing the sentence without the relative pronoun. Use _qui_ if the antecedent is the subject; otherwise, use _que_.

*   Subject: _La fille **qui** lit un menu._ ⇒ _La fille lit un menu._
*   Object: _C'est l'homme **que** je connais._ ⇒ _Je connais l'homme._

## The Reflexive Pronoun _Se_

A **reflexive pronoun** like _se_ can be used to indicate that a verb acts upon the subject. _Se_ is used with all third-person subjects, regardless of gender and number.

*   _Il **s**'aime._ — He loves **himself**.
*   _Il **s**'appelle comment ?_ — What's his name? (Lit, "He calls **himself** what?")
*   _Elle **se** demande pourquoi._ — She wonders why. (Lit, "She asks **herself** why.")

When _se_ refers to a plural subject, it can also be reciprocal or mutual ("each other").

*   _Ils **s**'aiment._ — They love **each other**.
*   _Les filles **se** parlent._ — The girls speak to **each other**.
*   _On **se** parle quand ?_ — When do we speak to **each other**?
*   _On **se** voit bientôt._ — We will see **each other** soon.

Certain pronouns can be added to the end of the sentence to differentiate between reflexive and reciprocal uses if necessary.

*   _Ils s'aiment **eux-mêmes**._ — They love themselves.
*   _Elles s'aiment **elles-mêmes**._ — They love themselves.
*   _Ils s'aiment **l'un l'autre**._ — They love each other.
*   _Elles s'aiment **les unes les autres**._ — They love one another.

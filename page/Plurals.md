# Plurals

Most plural forms of nouns and adjectives can be formed by appending an _-s_ to the singular, but remember that this _-s_ is usually silent.

*   _Le chat noir_ — The black cat ⇒ _Le**s** chat**s** noir**s**_ — The black cats

Articles must agree with the nouns they modify, so plural nouns require either _les_ or _des_. This is a great way to tell if a noun is plural. If you hear _les_ or _des_ (which sound similar to "lay" and "day"), then the noun is plural. If not, it's probably singular.

Remember that verbs change conjugation to agree with their subjects in both grammatical person and number.

## Punctuation

There are no quotation marks in French. Instead, the French use _guillemets_ (« »). Exclamation marks (!), question marks (?), colons (:), semicolons (;) and guillemets need to have a space on either side.

*   Incorrect: "Ça va?"
*   Correct: « Ça va ? »

When writing numbers in French, commas are decimal points, while spaces mark thousands places.

*   Incorrect: 1,235.8
*   Correct: 1 235,8

## The Partitive Article

The partitive article is used for unspecified amounts of uncountable nouns. In English, it can translate to "some", but it's often just omitted. Remember that _du_ is a contraction of _de + le_ and that partitives can elide.

Nouns almost never appear without articles in French, so articles must be repeated in serial lists.

*   _Il cuisine du poisson et de la viande_ — He cooks fish and meat.

## Count Noun, Mass Noun, or Both?

**Count nouns** are discrete and can be counted, like _une pomme_ ("an apple"). They can be modified by definite and indefinite articles, but not partitive articles.

*   _Je mange une pomme._ — I eat an apple.
*   _Nous mangeons les pommes._ — We are eating the apples.

**Mass nouns** like _lait_ ("milk") are uncountable, and they can be modified by definite and partitive articles, but not indefinite articles.

*   _Je bois du lait._ — I am drinking [some] milk.
*   _Je bois le lait._ — I am drinking the milk.

However, many nouns can behave as both count nouns and mass nouns. This is true for most edible things. For instance, consider _poisson_ ("fish") or _vin_ ("wine"):

*   Count noun: _Le poisson est rouge._ — The fish is red.
*   Mass noun: _Je mange du poisson._ — I eat [some] fish.
*   Count noun: _Le vin est blanc._ — The wine is white.
*   Mass noun: _Je bois du vin rouge ou blanc._ — I drink red or white wine.

Note that some mass nouns can be pluralized in English when they refer to multiple types of the noun, but this usage isn't found in French. For instance, "the fishes" refers to multiple _species_ of fish, while _les poissons_ just refers to multiple fish.

## Omitted Articles

When an article is missing in an English sentence, it must be added to the French translation. The definite article can be used to fill this void in three situations:

1.  Almost anywhere one would use "the" in English (i.e. when referring to specific things).
2.  Before the **subject** of a sentence to state general truths about it.
3.  Before the **direct object** of a verb of appreciation (like _aimer_) to express like/dislike.

If any of the above is true, then use the definite article. Otherwise, use the indefinite or partitive, depending on whether or not the noun is countable.

*   I like wine, but I am drinking milk. — _J'aime **le** vin, mais je bois **du** lait._

Both articles are missing in the English version of this example. _Aimer_ expresses fondness for wine, so _le vin_ should be used there. However, _boire_ is not a verb of appreciation, so the partitive _du_ should be used on the uncountable _lait_.

*   Cats are animals. — **_Les_** _chats sont **des** animaux._

This is a general truth about cats, but #2 above can only apply to subjects, so only _chats_ takes a definite article here. _Animaux_ are countable, so use the plural indefinite _des_.

*   He likes to eat meat. — _Il aime manger **de la** viande._

This is a tricky example because the meat is the direct object of _manger_, not _aimer_. Thus, #3 does not apply and _viande_ cannot take a definite article.

Also, the French definite article can be ambiguous when translating from French to English. It can often refer to both a specific noun and the general sense of a noun.

*   _Les chats sont des animaux._ — Cats are animals. / **The** cats are animals.

## _De_ + Definite Article

_De_ plus a definite article can also have other meanings. _De_ means "of" or "from", so this can also indicate possession or association with a definite noun.

*   _La copie **du** livre._ — The copy **of the** book.
*   _Les copies **des** livres._ — The copies **of the** books.
*   _L'enfant **de la** femme._ — The woman**'s** child.

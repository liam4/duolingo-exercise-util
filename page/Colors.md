# Colors

Colors can be both nouns and adjectives. As nouns, colors are usually masculine.

*   _Le rose._ — The pink.

As adjectives, they agree with the nouns they modify except in two cases. First, colors derived from nouns (e.g. fruits, flowers, or gems) tend to be invariable with gender and number. _Orange_ ("orange") and _marron_ ("brown") are the most common examples.

*   _La jupe orange_ — The orange skirt
*   _Les jupes orange_ — The orange skirts
*   _Les chiens marron._ — The brown dogs.

Second, in compound adjectives (_les adjectifs composés_) made up of two adjectives, both adjectives remain in their masculine singular forms.

*   _Sa couleur est vert pomme._ — Its color is apple-green.
*   _J'aime les robes rose clair._ — I like light-pink dresses.

Most colors that end in _-e_ in their masculine forms are invariable with gender.

*   _Un chien rouge_ — A red dog
*   _Une jupe rouge_ — A red skirt

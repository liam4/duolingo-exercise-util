<p>Grammar notes like those below can be helpful if you're having trouble with the lessons, so consider trying the lessons above before reading the notes. They'll be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them.</p>
<h2>Genders</h2>
<p>French has two grammatical genders: <strong>masculine</strong> and <strong>feminine</strong>. All nouns have a gender that you must memorize. Sometimes, the gender can be obvious: <em>une femme</em> ("a woman") is feminine. Other times, it's not obvious: <em>une pomme</em> ("an apple") is also feminine.</p>
<h2>Personal Subject Pronouns</h2>
<p>In every complete sentence, the <strong>subject</strong> is the person or thing that performs an action or is being described. This is often a noun, but a <strong>personal subject pronoun</strong> (e.g. "I", "you", or "he") can replace that noun. In both English and French, pronouns have different forms based on what they replace.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>English</th>
<th>French</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>je</td>
<td><em>Je mange.</em> — I eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You (singular)</td>
<td>tu/vous</td>
<td><em>Tu manges.</em> — You eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He/It</td>
<td>il</td>
<td><em>Il mange.</em> — He eats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>She/It</td>
<td>elle</td>
<td><em>Elle mange.</em> — She eats.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>
<p>Notice above that the verb <em>manger</em> (as well as its English equivalent, "to eat") changes form to agree grammatically with the subject. These forms are called <strong>conjugations</strong> of that verb. Whenever you want to learn a verb's conjugation, hover your mouse over that word and press the "C" button. </p>
<p>Here are some conjugations for verbs you'll encounter in this unit:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th><em>Manger</em> (To Eat)</th>
<th><em>Être</em> (To Be)</th>
<th><em>Avoir</em> (To Have)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>je</td>
<td><em>je mange</em> — I eat</td>
<td><em>je suis</em> — I am</td>
<td><em>j'ai</em> — I have</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tu</td>
<td><em>tu manges</em> — you eat</td>
<td><em>tu es</em> — you are</td>
<td><em>tu as</em> — you have</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>il/elle/on</td>
<td><em>il mange</em> — he eats</td>
<td><em>il est</em> — he is</td>
<td><em>il a</em> — he has</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>Articles</h2>
<p><strong>Articles</strong> (e.g. "the" or "a") provide context for a noun. In English, articles may be omitted, but French nouns almost always have an article. French has three types of articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definite articles</strong> ("the") are used with specific nouns that are known to the speakers.</li>
<li><strong>Indefinite articles</strong> ("a"/"an"/"one") are used for countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers.</li>
<li><strong>Partitive articles</strong> ("some"/"any") indicate a quantity of something uncountable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles have multiple forms, as provided in this table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Article</th>
<th>Masculine</th>
<th>Feminine</th>
<th>Plural</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Definite</td>
<td>le/l'</td>
<td>la/l'</td>
<td>les</td>
<td><strong><em>le</em></strong> <em>chat</em> — the cat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indefinite</td>
<td>un</td>
<td>une</td>
<td>des</td>
<td><strong><em>une</em></strong> <em>femme</em> — a woman</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Partitive</td>
<td>du/de l'</td>
<td>de la/de l'</td>
<td />
<td><strong><em>de l</em></strong><em>'eau</em> — (some) water</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is critical to understand that articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. For instance, <em>le femme</em> is incorrect. It must be <em>la femme</em> because <em>la</em> is feminine and singular, just like <em>femme</em>.</p>
<h2>Elisions</h2>
<p><em>Le</em> and <em>la</em> become just <em>l'</em> if they're followed by a vowel sound. This is an example of <strong>elision</strong>, which is the removal of a vowel sound in order to prevent consecutive vowel sounds and make pronunciation easier. Elisions are mandatory—for instance, <em>je aime</em> is incorrect. It must be <em>j'aime</em>.</p>
<p>These other one-syllable words can also elide: <em>je</em>, <em>me</em>, <em>te</em>, <em>se</em>, <em>de</em>, <em>ne</em>, and <em>que</em>. <em>Tu</em> can also be elided in casual speech, but not in writing (including on Duolingo).</p>
<h2>Contractions</h2>
<p>In a <strong>contraction</strong>, two words combine to form one shortened word. For instance, the partitive article <em>du</em> is a contraction of the preposition <em>de</em> with <em>le</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>du pain</em> — (some) bread</li>
</ul>
<p>However, since <em>du</em> can create vowel conflicts, when it would appear in front of a vowel sound, it takes the elided <em>de l'</em> form instead. This is also the case for <em>de la</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>de l'ananas</em> [masc.] — (some) pineapple</li>
<li><em>de l'eau</em> [fem.] — (some) water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Words Beginning with H</h2>
<p>The letter H is always mute (silent) in French, but when H starts a word, it can act as a consonant (aspirate) or vowel (non-aspirate). For example, the H in <em>homme</em> acts as a vowel. This means that "the man" must be written as <em>l'homme</em>.</p>
<p>Conversely, an aspirate H doesn't participate in elisions or liaisons (which you'll learn about soon). It's usually found at the beginning of loanwords from German or other languages. For instance, "the hero" is <em>le héros</em>. Pay attention to this when learning new vocabulary.</p>

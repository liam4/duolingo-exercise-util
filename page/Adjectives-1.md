# Adjectives 1

## Agreement

Unlike English adjectives, French adjectives must agree in number and gender with the nouns that they modify. A black dog is _un chien noir_, but a black dress is _une robe noire_. Also, remember that some adjectives have the same masculine and feminine form, especially those ending in a silent _-e_ (e.g. _riche_).

When used with pronouns, adjectives agree with the noun that has been replaced. This is particularly tricky with the formal _vous_: to a singular man, you would say _vous êtes beau_, but to plural women, you would say _vous êtes belles_.

## Adjective Placement

In French, most adjectives appear after the nouns they modify. For instance, _le chat noir_. However, some adjectives precede the noun. You can remember these types of nouns using the mnemonic **BANGS**.

*   **B** is for beauty. _Une belle femme_ — A beautiful woman
*   **A** is for age. _Une jeune fille_ — A young girl
*   **N** is for number. _Deux hommes_ — Two men
    *   This can also be for rank: _Le premier mot_ — The first word
*   **G** is for good or bad. _Un bon garçon_ — A good boy
*   **S** is for size. _Un gros chat_ — A fat cat

All determiner adjectives (e.g. possessives, interrogatives, and demonstratives) appear before the noun, e.g. _mon livre_ ("my book") and _ce cochon_ ("that pig"). You will learn these later.

## Figurative Adjectives

A few adjectives can come both before and after the noun depending on their meaning. The most common example is _grand_, which is a BANGS adjective for everything but people. For people, it comes before a noun when it means "important" and after the noun when it means "tall". For instance, Napoleon was _un grand homme_ ("a great man"), but not _un homme grand_ ("a tall man").

Usually, figurative meanings will precede the noun, while literal meanings will follow the noun.

*   _un **pauvre** homme_ — a pitiful man
*   _un homme **pauvre**_ — a poor man
*   _un **certain** nombre_ — a certain (particular) number
*   _une victoire **certaine**_ — a certain (guaranteed) victory
*   _ma **propre** voiture_ — my own car
*   _ma voiture **propre**_ — my clean car
*   _un **cher** ami_ — a dear friend
*   _une montre **chère**_ — an expensive watch

## Euphony

As you have already learned, elisions, contractions, liaisons, and enchaînements are all designed to prevent consecutive vowel sounds (which is called **hiatus**). This quest for harmonious sounds is called **euphony** and is an essential feature of French. It has, however, created some unexpected rules.

For instance, the masculine _beau_ ("beautiful") changes to _bel_ if its noun begins with a vowel sound. A beautiful man is _un bel homme_. The other two common changes are _vieux_ to _vieil_ ("old") and _nouveau_ to _nouvel_ ("new").

Note that this doesn't occur to feminine adjectives because they usually end in silent vowels.

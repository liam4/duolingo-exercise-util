# Basics 1

Grammar notes like those below can be helpful if you're having trouble with the lessons, so consider trying the lessons above before reading the notes. They'll be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them.

## Genders

French has two grammatical genders: **masculine** and **feminine**. All nouns have a gender that you must memorize. Sometimes, the gender can be obvious: _une femme_ ("a woman") is feminine. Other times, it's not obvious: _une pomme_ ("an apple") is also feminine.

## Personal Subject Pronouns

In every complete sentence, the **subject** is the person or thing that performs an action or is being described. This is often a noun, but a **personal subject pronoun** (e.g. "I", "you", or "he") can replace that noun. In both English and French, pronouns have different forms based on what they replace.

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>English</th>

<th>French</th>

<th>Example</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>I</td>

<td>je</td>

<td>_Je mange._ — I eat.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>You (singular)</td>

<td>tu/vous</td>

<td>_Tu manges._ — You eat.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>He/It</td>

<td>il</td>

<td>_Il mange._ — He eats.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>She/It</td>

<td>elle</td>

<td>_Elle mange._ — She eats.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

## Subject-Verb Agreement

Notice above that the verb _manger_ (as well as its English equivalent, "to eat") changes form to agree grammatically with the subject. These forms are called **conjugations** of that verb. Whenever you want to learn a verb's conjugation, hover your mouse over that word and press the "C" button.

Here are some conjugations for verbs you'll encounter in this unit:

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Subject</th>

<th>_Manger_ (To Eat)</th>

<th>_Être_ (To Be)</th>

<th>_Avoir_ (To Have)</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>je</td>

<td>_je mange_ — I eat</td>

<td>_je suis_ — I am</td>

<td>_j'ai_ — I have</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>tu</td>

<td>_tu manges_ — you eat</td>

<td>_tu es_ — you are</td>

<td>_tu as_ — you have</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>il/elle/on</td>

<td>_il mange_ — he eats</td>

<td>_il est_ — he is</td>

<td>_il a_ — he has</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

## Articles

**Articles** (e.g. "the" or "a") provide context for a noun. In English, articles may be omitted, but French nouns almost always have an article. French has three types of articles:

*   **Definite articles** ("the") are used with specific nouns that are known to the speakers.
*   **Indefinite articles** ("a"/"an"/"one") are used for countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers.
*   **Partitive articles** ("some"/"any") indicate a quantity of something uncountable.

Articles have multiple forms, as provided in this table:

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Article</th>

<th>Masculine</th>

<th>Feminine</th>

<th>Plural</th>

<th>Example</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>Definite</td>

<td>le/l'</td>

<td>la/l'</td>

<td>les</td>

<td>**_le_** _chat_ — the cat</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Indefinite</td>

<td>un</td>

<td>une</td>

<td>des</td>

<td>**_une_** _femme_ — a woman</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Partitive</td>

<td>du/de l'</td>

<td>de la/de l'</td>

<td></td>

<td>**_de l_**_'eau_ — (some) water</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

It is critical to understand that articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. For instance, _le femme_ is incorrect. It must be _la femme_ because _la_ is feminine and singular, just like _femme_.

## Elisions

_Le_ and _la_ become just _l'_ if they're followed by a vowel sound. This is an example of **elision**, which is the removal of a vowel sound in order to prevent consecutive vowel sounds and make pronunciation easier. Elisions are mandatory—for instance, _je aime_ is incorrect. It must be _j'aime_.

These other one-syllable words can also elide: _je_, _me_, _te_, _se_, _de_, _ne_, and _que_. _Tu_ can also be elided in casual speech, but not in writing (including on Duolingo).

## Contractions

In a **contraction**, two words combine to form one shortened word. For instance, the partitive article _du_ is a contraction of the preposition _de_ with _le_.

*   _du pain_ — (some) bread

However, since _du_ can create vowel conflicts, when it would appear in front of a vowel sound, it takes the elided _de l'_ form instead. This is also the case for _de la_.

*   _de l'ananas_ [masc.] — (some) pineapple
*   _de l'eau_ [fem.] — (some) water

## Words Beginning with H

The letter H is always mute (silent) in French, but when H starts a word, it can act as a consonant (aspirate) or vowel (non-aspirate). For example, the H in _homme_ acts as a vowel. This means that "the man" must be written as _l'homme_.

Conversely, an aspirate H doesn't participate in elisions or liaisons (which you'll learn about soon). It's usually found at the beginning of loanwords from German or other languages. For instance, "the hero" is _le héros_. Pay attention to this when learning new vocabulary.

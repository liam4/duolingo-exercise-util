# Demonstratives 2

## _Ceci_ and _Cela_

**_Ceci_** ("this") and **_cela_** ("that") are the formal versions of the indefinite demonstrative pronoun _ça_ ("this" or "that"). These are used when pointing something out, referring to something indefinite (like an idea), or referring back to something already mentioned.

*   _Je connais cela._ — I know about that.
*   _Je veux ceci._ — I want this.

_Ceci_ is usually only used when making a distinction between "this" and "that". Otherwise, _cela_ is preferred in writing and _ça_ is preferred in speech.

### _Ce_ or _Cela_?

Remember that _ce_ can only be used with _être_, including _devoir être_ and _pouvoir être_.

*   _C’est un très bon vin !_ – This is a really good wine!
*   _Ce doit être ton fils._ — It must be your son.

However, _cela_ and _ceci_ can also be used with _être_ for emphasis.

*   _C'est le mien._ — It's mine.
*   _Non, ceci est le mien. Cela est le tien._ — No, THIS is mine. THAT is yours.

_Cela/ceci/ça_ should be used with all other verbs.

*   _Cela arrive souvent._ — It happens often. / That happens often.
*   _Ceci contient un bonbon._ — This contains a candy.

## Demonstrative Pronouns

**Demonstrative pronouns** (e.g. "this one", "that one", "these", "those") replace a demonstrative adjective + noun for the sake of avoiding repetition. Like most other pronouns, they agree in gender and number with the noun they replace.

Demonstrative pronouns refer to a very specific thing and cannot stand alone. They must be used in one of three constructions.

### Demonstrative Pronoun + Relative Pronoun

A relative pronoun and dependent clause can follow the demonstrative pronoun. For instance, you can use _que_ when the relative pronoun is the direct object and use _qui_ when it's the subject.

*   **_Celui qui_** _est dans ma poche._ — The one that is in my pocket.
*   **_Ceux que_** _je connais._ — The ones that I know. / The ones whom I know.

### Demonstrative Pronoun + Preposition

The preposition _de_ can appear after the demonstrative pronoun to indicate possession.

*   _À qui est cette balle ?_ – Whose ball is this?
*   _C'est **celle du** chien._ — It's the dog's. (Literally: "It is the one of the dog.")

### Demonstrative Pronoun + Suffix

This construction appears in "Demonstratives 3".

### Usage Examples

Demonstrative pronouns are often used in comparisons or choices between alternatives.

*   _Ce tableau est moins beau que **celui de** Rembrandt._ — This painting is less beautiful than that by Rembrandt.
*   _Quelle robe préfères-tu ? **Celle de** Paris ou **celle de** Tokyo ?_ — Which dress do you prefer? The one from Paris or the one from Tokyo?

They can also be used within prepositional phrases.

*   _Je pense **à celles qui** sont en vacances._ — I am thinking about the ones who are on vacation.
*   _Ce repas est **pour ceux qui** aiment les oignons._ — This meal is for those who like onions.
